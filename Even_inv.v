  Theorem Even_0_inv (P : Even 0 -> Prop) (e : Even 0) :
    P ev_0 -> P e.
  Proof.
    now destruct (even_inv e).
  Defined.


  Theorem Even_1_inv (P : Even 1 -> Prop) (e : Even 1) : False.
  Proof.
     now destruct (even_inv e).
  Defined.

  Theorem Even_2_inv (n : nat) (P : Even (2 + n) -> Prop) (e : Even (2 + n)) :
     (âˆ€ (u : Even n), P (ev_2 u)) -> P e.
  Proof.
    now destruct (even_inv e).
  Defined.

  Theorem ev_sss : forall (n : nat), Even (2 + n) -> Even n.
  Proof.
    intros * Ha.
    eapply Even_2_inv with n;

  Qed.

  Theorem ev_o : forall (e : Even 0), e = ev_0.
  Proof.
